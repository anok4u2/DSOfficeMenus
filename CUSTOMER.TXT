                      CUSTOMER Demonstration Program

   *********************************************************************


   CUSTOMER Demonstration Program
   ------------------------------


   Overview
   --------

   This CUSTOMER example program is the same program as supplied with
   character mode Dialog System. Its purpose is to show how to call
   a Dialog System Graphical screenset, using the same call interface
   as used for Character Mode Dialog System. This is to allow easier
   migration from character mode interfaces to graphical mode interfaces.

   The Dialog System Graphical Mode version of the Character Mode call
   interface is defined in DS-CNTRL.V1. This file has the same layout
   as the DS-CNTRL.MF file supplied with Character Mode Dialog System.

   The more advanced graphical call interface is supplied in DS-CNTRL.MF.
   It is advisable to switch to using this interface, so that the more
   advanced features in graphical Dialog System may be used, for example,
   30 character alphanumeric procedure names.

   Extra Notes
   -----------

   When you compile a program from within the Net Express IDE, the
   INT and IDY files may (depending on your project's build type) be
   placed in a directory below your working directory. When running the
   demonstration outside of the IDE you must make sure the project build
   directory is on your COBDIR.
